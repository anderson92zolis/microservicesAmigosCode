# microservicesAmigosCode

// part 1

I will give the microservices architecture overview and will build one microservice that connects to its own database running on docker.

Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

- Highly maintainable and testable
- Loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Organized around business capabilities
- Owned by a small team

The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organisation to evolve its technology stack.
