# microservicesAmigosCode

// part #1  parent configuration & first microservices

I will give the microservices architecture overview and will build one microservice that connects to its own database running on docker.

Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

- Highly maintainable and testable
- Loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Organized around business capabilities
- Owned by a small team

The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organisation to evolve its technology stack.


// part #2   HTTP Communication 

Internal communication between Customer and Fraud Microservice

- Fraud Microservice
- Database Setup
- Controller Service and Repository
- RestTemplate
- Microservices HTTP Communication In Action

// part 3 # Server Discovery and Load Balancer

creating the Eureka server microservices and Eureka clients. 
- config the parent project and the rest of microservices customer and fraud (pom.xml, application.yml)

When building Distributed systems having a load balancer is key to any organisation. I learnd what is load balancers, load balancer algorithms, load balancer health checks and the benefits of having a load balancer.
